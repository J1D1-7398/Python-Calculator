# Python-Calculator
A simple calculator in Python using Tkinter library (Used to create GUIs) I will try to stay as active as possible and solve errors. I will update this repo regularly adding new calculators (I already have some in mind but if you want a specific one i will try and code it). Feel free to make any suggestions!

This program was only tested on Windows so it may break on other systems


## Requirements:
### Python:

### Tkinter:

⚠️ Before finishing the installation process do this next steps:

When you arrive at "Optional Features", select "Tcl/Tk, turtle and IDLE" (turtle is not necessary but it comes bundled together)

Finish installation


## How to use the app:

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded the repository. Remember to enter in "Code" folder, where the python files are stored

When you have reached the directory in Command Prompt type `python main.py`

✅ It should work fine!
