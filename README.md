# Python-Calculator
A simple calculator in Python using Tkinter library (Used to create GUIs) I will try to stay as active as possible and solve errors. I will update this repo regularly adding new calculators (I already have some in mind but if you want a specific one i will try and code it). Feel free to make any suggestions!

This program was only tested on Windows so it could break on Linux or MacOS

## **How to install python**

Go to the official website of python (python.org)

On the menu, press "Downloads"

When the download finishes, go to downloads (Or the folder you chose to download files) and double click it

Go to custom installation

Follow the instructions on screen

When you arrive at "Optional Features", select "Tcl/Tk, turtle and IDLE" (turtle is not necessary but it comes bundled together)

Finish installation


## **How to use the app**

Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned/downloaded the repository. Remember to enter in "Code" folder, where the python files are stored

When you have reached the directory in Command Prompt type `python main.py`

It should work fine!
